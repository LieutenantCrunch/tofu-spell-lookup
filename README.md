# Tofu Spell Lookup
## Issue
Tofu recently implemented Spells, which come in 4 types:

1. Color Shift
2. Font
3. Special
4. Text Color

Color Shift spells are further broken into 2(?) types:

1. Spells that apply a hue rotation to the frame, henceforth referred to as **hue shifts**.
2. Spells that apply a solid hue to the frame (with varying blending modes), henceforth referred to as **blends**.

A user's spells can be seen with the `tspells` command. Spells can be filtered by the 4 primary types and emoji are used to quickly visualize the effect the spell will have. *However*, it is impossible to visualize the effect that hue shifts will have. This is due to the fact that the hue rotation causes different parts of the frames to become different colors based on their starting colors, for example, red parts become green and green parts become blue. This has resulted in numerous requests from the community for a web interface to view their spells.

## Solution
- Create a web interface that will allow users to quickly see how their hue shifts will look on all frames without causing a strain on the Tofu server.
- Create a visual search where users can adjust a dummy frame to look the way they want and then be shown the spells they own that result in a similar appearance.

## How This Project Helps
This project implements the web interface and visual search discussed in the solution. All work is done purely through CSS and does not require any server-side image processing.
In addition, the ability to test full hues, fonts, and text colors has been added to the page, allowing users to quickly test any combinations of spells. Special spell previews have not been implemented in this project due to the nature of how they affect the images.

## Recommendations
A few emoji changes to the Discord UI for each spell type are recommended to further help users. Based on the `thex` command, it is assumed that it is possible for 2 emoji to be displayed for each spell. For formatting purposes, assume that if a second emoji is not specified, the Black Small Square (‚ñ™Ô∏è) will be used as the second emoji.
- Color Shift
  - Hue Shift
    - Low Brightness Symbol (üîÖ)
      - No Change. These cannot be adequately represented through emoji.
  - Blend
    - Custom Tofu Circle or standard Circle (üü¢)
      - This should give the users an indication of the color the frame will turn when applied
    - Keycap Digits (1Ô∏è‚É£)
      - This will indicate the type of blend mode used. In time, users can learn the assocation between symbols and modes.
- Font
  - Latin Capital Letters (üî†)
    - No Change. In time, users will learn the font names and what they look like.
- Special
  - Custom Tofu Special Circle
    - No Change. In time, users will learn the spell names and what they look like.
- Text Color
  - Custom Tofu Circle
    - No Change. These already indicate the color the font will change
